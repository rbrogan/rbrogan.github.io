<p>To foresee what will work in times to come, it is well to understand why what has worked, did work. Within software engineering, I cannot think of a technology that has had a greater impact on mass consciousness than object-orientation. </p>
<p>
OO is successful based on <i>how it works psychologically</i>. Theoretically, people can solve the same problems with other technologies; we can imagine an alternate universe with some other paradigm being dominant. In practice, for various reasons, people do not use other technologies to nearly the same degree as OO.
</p>
<p>
OO is successful because many people use it. These people use OO concepts and language to <i>intuitively</i> factor the world and describe a future. They form intentions to make software and communicate their thinking with other people by using OO terms. There is more to making software than typing on a keyboard; that is why OO is successful.

<p>Say we see this guy sitting at a computer, reading and writing code. Someone comes over and they speak. The guy goes back to work for a bit. He stops and goes to a meeting where he sits around a table and discusses things; he gets up at a white board and draws pictures and labels things. This is making software.</p>

<p>Nowhere here does OO appear to be necessary, so how can we account for its success? What difference does it make using OO?</p>

<p>First, the code on the screen means what it says; the program reflects a model that reflects the world. When two people talk, they talk along the lines of responsibilities and interfaces. In a meeting, people who better know what the software needs to do can communicate it in a language very close to the one used to write the code. This matters.</p>

<p>These are consequences of people using OO but they are not a good enough reason as to why. What are people doing different with OO versus other techs? They are tapping into the simple and common wetware they already have.</p>

<p>An object is both code and data, but also neither. This means people can talk about objects and yet not have to talk about either data or code. <i>Ghost first, then machine</i>; that is how people like to think. If something happened then that means someone did it; if work has to get done then someone has to do it. OO fits with that thinking very well: Think up an object that will do the thing and figure out the rest later. This is very important for forming intentions. People form intentions in order to do things.</p>
<p>
People use OO because they are already able; and because they are able, it works.

Lately, I have not used much OO and was going to write a piece about the shortcomings of OO; I wound up writing this instead. Maybe it is like this: say why so before why not.

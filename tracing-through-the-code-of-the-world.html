We come preloaded with wetware. To do good, we need to be good at using it. Specifically, let us talk about dealing in information. Who can be good at software that is bad at information?
</p>
<p>
We come upon this world like a legacy code base: not documented so well, nor easy to figure out. We have to do quite a bit of self-teaching. You can spend hours on an aggregator and learn a lot, but also have no idea what is going on. What we need is tech for making information ourselves.
</p>
<p>
You may have heard the term "narrative". People (sociologists) said: "Look, we humans are <i>natural storytellers</i>. Information about the world is stored in stories, so let us agree that we can legitimately come to know things through them." 
</p>
<p>
Let us take narrative to be "information via stories having meaning". You can see from the examples below, we already use them in the software world.

Now, what if you were to make a conscious effort when you trace through the code of the world to read it as a story? Surely, you would improve your comprehension and put yourself in good position to be a contributor.

How well can you learn if no one is teaching you and you are not thinking things through?
</p>
<p>
OK, but suppose no one is teaching because no one knows. Still, we can make our own efforts and  think things through for ourselves. We are going to need something to direct our efforts instead of just "trying" in the abstract.
</p>
<p>
Let us imagine that we have a way of learning. What is it like? Somehow it is like going through a codebase, browsing through the files, and figuring out how the program works. Well, suppose that we were to do that and then someone were to ask: "Genius of software, how were you able to figure it out?" What would we say? We might say something like: "Well, this is a program of such-and-such a type. Once I saw that there, I knew to look for this kind of thing." In other words, we have patterns and we match pieces to them. Once we match one piece, the pattern gives us other pieces to look for next. (Sound like parsing?)
</p>
<p>
OK, so we know what we are looking for. We want something like the above, except we want it to be for the experiences we have and the events we read about. For a narrative, this would be the plot type. Check out the table below for some examples of plot types and see if you do not think that you could match events and experiences to these.

Of course, not everything always perfectly fits pre-existing patterns (certainly not all programs fit into design patterns), but you can take plot types as a starting point. When they do not work, then you will see where and figure out why. From there, you write your own story.
